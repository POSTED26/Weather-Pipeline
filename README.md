## Weather Data Pipeline

### Goals
  - Learn about airflow to automate ELT tasks
  - Learn about spark to clean and transform data
  - Learn about cloud services like AWS S3 (possibly redshift, glue) for data storage
  - Learn to create visuals using grafana

### Projected Tasks
  - Pull weather data down hourly for a few citys
  - take json api data and put in parquet file to store on s3
  - look into the api for the possibility pulling bulk data down to really test how much data the pipeline can handle
  - load data into s3 and then clean and transform into star data model
  - figure out if I need to store more structured data in a separate place than s3
  - use grafana to create interactive viauals for weather data
